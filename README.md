## Boilerplate for NodeJS and Express server with typescript

Most of the boilerplates in GH include things that are not necessary to start a Node server.
This template includes only the bare minimum, feel free to clone and use this repository as your starting point.

> ℹ️ You can also contact me and try to suggest what to add to this boilerplate or even create a PR, keep in mind that the 
main idea is to have the bareminimum.
